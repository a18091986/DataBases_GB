2. Используя сервис http://filldb.info , https://www.mockaroo.com/ или другой по вашему желанию, сгенерировать тестовые данные для всех таблиц, используя vk-data.sql, учитывая логику связей. Для всех таблиц, где это имеет смысл, создать не менее 100 строк. Для media_types создать ровно 4 строки. Загрузить тестовые данные. Приложить к отчёту полученный дамп с данными.
